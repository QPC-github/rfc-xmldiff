				The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", 
				"REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
				"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
				"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
				"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as 
				described in RFC 8174 <xref target="RFC8174"/>.
			</t>

		</section>
		
		<section title="Background">

			<t>
				Mobile communication has been rapidly improved from low bit rate circuit 
				switched system to the higher data rate
				packet switched system. The packet switched system has added mobile capability 
				of Internet Protocol (IP)
				connectivity and thereby the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) have made SIP based 
				calls and IP multimedia 
				sessions from mobile devices possible.
			</t>

			<t>
				3GPP2 defines High Rate Packet Data (HRPD) with high data rates and it dispenses with the 
				1x Circuit Switched (1xCS) infrastructure.
				This means that with HRPD networks, voice calls will need to be conducted using IP and IMS. 
				However,
				the transition to all IP, SIP based IMS networks worldwide will take a great 
				many years from the time of this writing and mobile devices
				will need to operate in both IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit switched mode. This 
				means that calls and sessions
				will need to be handed over between IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit switched mode 
				mid-call or mid-session. 
				To achieve this the mobile
				device needs to simultaneously communicate via both the IP/SIP/IMS domain and 
				the circuit switched domain.
			</t>

			<t>
				To meet this need 3GPP2 has specified how to maintain voice session continuity 
				between the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the 
				circuit switched domain in 3GPP2 S.X0042-B <xref target="refs.S.X0042-B"/>.
			</t>

			<t> 
				In order for the mobile device to access SIP/IMS voice service via the circuit switched 
				domain 3GPP2 has specified 
				that Mobile Switching Center (MSC) server either via IMS Media Gateway Control Function 
				(MGCF) or directly, if enhanced
				by SIP interface, controls mobile voice call setup over the circuit switched radio access 
				while establishing the 
				corresponding voice session in the core network using SIP/IMS. To enable this, the mobile 
				device MUST be identified in 
				both 1xCS and IP/SIP/IMS domains. The only mobile device identifier that is transportable 
				using 1xCS signaling is 
				the MEID therefore the instance-id included by the MGCF or the MSC server, and the 
				instance-id directly included
				by the mobile device both need to be based on the MEID.
			</t>

			<t>
				Additionally in order to meet the above requirements, the same MEID that is obtained from the circuit switched 
				signaling by the MSC server needs to be obtainable from SIP signaling so that it can be determined that both 
				the SIP signaling and circuit switched signaling originate from the same mobile device.
			</t>
				


		</section>

		<section title="3GPP2 Use Cases">

			<t>
				1. The mobile device includes its MEID in the SIP REGISTER request so that the SIP registrar can perform a check 
				of the Equipment
				Identity Register (EIR) to verify if this mobile device is allowed or barred from accessing the network for 
				non-emergency services
				(e.g., because it has been stolen). If the mobile device is not allowed to access the network 
				for non-emergency services the 
				SIP registrar can reject the registration. Thus a barred mobile device is prevented from accessing 
				the network for non-emergency 
				services.
			</t>


			<t>
				2. The mobile device includes its MEID in SIP INVITE requests used to establish emergency sessions. 
				This is so that the Public 
				Safety Answering Point (PSAP) can obtain the MEID of the mobile device for identification purposes 
				if required by regulations.
			</t>

			
			<t>
				3. The inclusion by the mobile device of its MEID in SIP INVITE requests used to 
				establish emergency sessions is also used in the 
				cases of unauthenticated emergency sessions to enable the network to identify the mobile device. 
				This is especially important if
				the unauthenticated emergency session is handed over from the packet switched domain to 
				the circuit switched domain. In this 
				scenario the MEID is the only identifier that is common to both domains. The 
				Emergency Access Transfer Function (EATF) which coordinates the call transfer between the domains, 
				can thus use the MEID to identify that 
				the circuit switched call is from the same mobile 
				device that was in the emergency session in the packet switched domain.
			</t>

		<section anchor="UAC" title="User Agent Client Procedures">

			<t>
				A single mode 3GPP2 User Agent Client (UAC)  which uses only 3GPP2
				technology to transmit and receive voice or data has an MEID as specified in 
				3GPP2 S.R0048-A <xref target="refs.S.R0048-A"/>. The single mode
			        3GPP2 UAC that is registering with a 3GPP2 IMS network 
				includes in the "sip.instance" media feature tag the 3GPP2 MEID URN according to 
				the syntax specified in 
				draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn <xref target="refs.draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn"/> 
				when performing the registration procedures
				specified in RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/> or RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/> or 
				any other procedure requiring the inclusion 
				of the "sip.instance" media feature tag.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				A UAC MUST NOT use the 3GPP2 MEID URN as an instance-id except when registering 
				with a 3GPP2 IMS network. When a UAC is operating in 
				IMS mode it will obtain the domain of the carrier's IMS network to register with, 
				from the Universal 
				Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), pre-configuration, or the network at the time of
				establishing the Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context. These three methods are carrier 
				specific and are only performed by the carrier IMS networks.
				The UAC will also obtain the address of the IMS edge 
				proxy to send the REGISTER request  containing
				the MEID using information elements in the Attach response when it attempts to 
				connect to the carriers packet data network. When 
				registering with a non-3GPP or non-3GPP2 IMS network a UAC SHOULD use a 
				Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) as an instance-id as 
				specified in RFC 5626 <xref target="RFC5626"/>.
			</t>
       

			<t>
				A UAC MUST NOT include the "sip.instance" media feature tag containing the 3GPP2 
				MEID URN in the Contact header field of non-REGISTER
				requests except when the request is related to an emergency session. Regulatory 
				requirements can require the MEID to be provided to 
				the PSAP. Any future exceptions to this prohibition require an RFC that addresses 
				how privacy is not violated by such a usage.

			       Since MEIDs like other formats of instance-ids can be correlated to a user, 
			       they are personally identifiable information and MUST
			       be treated as such. In particular, the "sip.instance" media feature tag containing the 
			       3GPP2 MEID URN MUST NOT be included in
			       requests or responses intended to convey any level of anonymity, as this could 
			       violate the users privacy. RFC 5626
			       <xref target="RFC5626"/> states "One case where a UA could prefer to omit the 
			       "sip.instance" media feature tag is when it is making
			       an anonymous request or some other privacy concern requires that the UA not 
			       reveal its identity". The same concerns apply when using
			       the 3GPP2 MEID URN as an instance-id. Publication of the 3GPP2 MEID URN to networks 
			       that the UA is not attached to or the UA does not
			       have a service relationship with is a security breach and the "sip.instance" media 
			       feature tag MUST NOT be forwarded by the service
			       provider's network elements when forwarding requests or responses towards the destination 
			       UA. The 3GPP2 MEID URN MUST NOT accidentally leak in other contexts, such as and in
particular when application servers subscribe to user registration state using
the event package defined in RFC 3680 <xref target="RFC3680"/>. Additionally, an instance-id containing
			       the 3GPP2 MEID URN identifies a mobile device and not a user. The instance-id containing 
			       the 3GPP2 MEID URN MUST NOT be used alone 
			       as an address for a user or as an identification credential for a user. The GRUU mechanism 
			       specified in RFC 5627 
			       <xref target="RFC5627"/> provides a means to create URIs that address the user at a 
			       specific device or User Agent.
		       </t> 
		       
		       <t>
			       Entities that log the instance-id need to protect them as personally identifiable 
			       information. Regulatory requirements can require
			       carriers to log SIP MEIDs. 
		       </t>

		       <t>
			       In order to protect the "sip.instance" media feature tag containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN 
			       from being tampered with, those REGISTER 
			       requests containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN MUST be sent using a security mechanism such as 
			       Transport Layer Security (TLS) as specified 
			       in RFC 4346 <xref target="RFC4346"/> or any other security mechanism that provides
