  describes a device enrollment solution that relies on the presence in the device of a factory-installed certificate.
  The <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-cose-ecdhe"/> draft was also written with the idea that long term certificates could be used to provide for
  authentication of devices, and uses them to establish session keys.
	A third scenario is the use of COSE as the basis for a secure messaging application.
  This scenario assumes the presence of long term keys and a central authentication authority.
  Basing such an application on public key certificates allows it to make use of well established key management disciplines.
