	Some of the constrained device situations are being used where an X.509 PKI is already installed.
	One of these situations is the 6TiSCH environment for enrollment of devices where the certificates are installed at the factory.
	The <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-cose-ecdhe"/> draft was also written with the idea that long term certificates could be used to provide for authentication of devices and uses them to establish session keys.
	A final scenario is the use of COSE as a messaging application where long term existence of keys can be used along with a central authentication authority.
	The use of certificates in this scenario allows for key management to be used which is well understood.
